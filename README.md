# Learning_ML
This repository is some of the things I hae worked on while learning about Machine Learning.

Currently this repository has two functional files made by me, those are the python files in the Regression folder. In that folder there ise a line of best fit file which does a simple linear regression. There is also a Polynomila Regression file.

# Polynomial Regression
If you would like to use the polynomial regression program, you can edit these values on lines 9-26 to customize the program to your needs. The comments in the file describe what each variable is used for. Additionally, the file has comments throughout describing how it functions if you are interested.

The program will output the following three graphs, but they will look different based on the inputs you entered and the random points generated by the program.
